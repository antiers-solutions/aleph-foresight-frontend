<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Aleph Foresight is a decentralized betting and event management platform built on blockchain. It allows users to create events, place bets, and manage various aspects of the betting process. Here are some key features and functionalities:

1. **Event Creation:** Users or admins can create events, specifying details like expiration time and betting closure time. The platform supports fee structures for both event creation and platform usage.

2. **Betting:** Users can place bets on events with options such as "Yes" or "No". The platform tracks betting pools and individual user bets securely.

3. **Event Creation:** Admins can set or update event results, adjust platform fees, and manage event expiration and bet closure times.

4. **Payouts and Claims:** After an event concludes, users can claim rewards based on their bets and the event result. The platform handles payouts to users, admin rewards, and event creation fees.
5. **Dispute Resolution:** Users can raise disputes if they believe there’s an issue with an event's outcome, within a specific time frame.
6. **Administration and Upgrades:** The platform includes administrative controls for setting fees and upgrading the smart contract for easy navigation and exploration.
